# Perspective Switching Analysis Protocol v2.0

## Purpose
Systematic methodology for expert cognitive debugging through deliberate perspective switching. Used when experts are stuck due to tunnel vision, rigid assumptions, or inability to identify root causes of problems.

## Core Principle
**Critical Insight**: Expert knowledge creates cognitive blind spots. Systematic switching to zero-context perspective acts as a cognitive mirror, revealing assumptions and wrong turns that expert perspective cannot see.

## Perspective Switching Markers

### Entering Expert Mode
**Cue**: "Activate full expert knowledge and experience"
**Mindset**: Access all technical knowledge, assumptions, and patterns

### Entering Zero-Context Mode  
**Cue**: "Completely forget expert knowledge - become a total beginner"
**Mindset**: No prior knowledge, no assumptions, fresh encounter

### Switching Validation
**Check**: "Am I genuinely in the target perspective or just pretending?"

## Protocol Steps

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
**Objective**: Document full expert context and knowledge

#### Step 1: Context Inventory
**Cognitive Mode**: Full Expert Awareness
**Switching Cue**: "Document everything I currently know and assume"
**Question**: What do I know that influences my approach?
**Method**: Comprehensive listing of:
- Technical knowledge and experience
- Setup procedures already performed
- System relationships and architecture understanding
- Assumptions about user capabilities
- Previous successful patterns and approaches
**Output Focus**: Complete expert knowledge baseline

#### Step 2: Knowledge Source Analysis
**Cognitive Mode**: Full Expert Awareness
**Switching Cue**: "Trace how I acquired this expertise"
**Question**: How did I acquire this knowledge?
**Method**: Document knowledge acquisition path:
- Direct experience and hands-on learning
- Documentation study and research
- Trial-and-error discovery
- Expert guidance or training
- Implicit assumptions from domain experience
**Output Focus**: Expert learning journey and knowledge sources

#### Step 3: Assumption Identification
**Cognitive Mode**: Full Expert Awareness
**Switching Cue**: "Surface all unconscious assumptions"
**Question**: What am I assuming users already know?
**Method**: List explicit and implicit assumptions about:
- Technical terminology understanding
- Prerequisite setup or configuration
- Familiarity with related systems
- Problem-solving capabilities
- Troubleshooting experience
**Output Focus**: Complete assumption inventory

### Phase 2: Target State Analysis
**Objective**: Model zero-context user perspective

#### Step 4: Zero-Context Modeling
**Cognitive Mode**: Complete Beginner
**Switching Cue**: "I have never encountered this before - what would I experience?"
**Question**: What would someone with no prior knowledge experience?
**Method**: Systematic perspective adoption:
- **Doesn't Know**: Everything expert takes for granted
- **Only Knows**: What's explicitly provided in instructions
- **Will Experience**: Raw first encounter without context
- **Will Struggle With**: Every unstated assumption or gap
**Output Focus**: Authentic beginner experience simulation

#### Step 5: Mental Model Gaps
**Cognitive Mode**: Complete Beginner
**Switching Cue**: "What conceptual frameworks am I missing?"
**Question**: What mental models are missing?
**Method**: Identify conceptual frameworks user needs:
- System architecture understanding
- Process flow comprehension
- Relationship between components
- Cause-and-effect patterns
- Success vs failure recognition
**Output Focus**: Missing conceptual foundations

#### Step 6: Experience Simulation
**Cognitive Mode**: Complete Beginner
**Switching Cue**: "Walk through this journey as a total novice"
**Question**: What will the user journey actually look like?
**Method**: Step-by-step experience prediction:
- First encounter with instructions
- Attempt to follow procedures
- Points of confusion or failure
- Information-seeking behavior
- Recovery attempts
**Output Focus**: Detailed novice journey with struggle points

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis
**Objective**: Identify and prioritize knowledge transfer requirements

#### Step 7: Critical Gap Identification
**Cognitive Mode**: Brief Dual Awareness
**Switching Cue**: "Compare expert and beginner perspectives"
**Question**: What are the most important knowledge gaps?
**Method**: Priority analysis of:
- **Blocking gaps**: Prevent any progress
- **Confusion gaps**: Cause misunderstanding
- **Efficiency gaps**: Lead to ineffective approaches
- **Recovery gaps**: Prevent error resolution
**Output Focus**: Priority-ranked cognitive gaps

#### Step 8: Bridge Requirements
**Cognitive Mode**: Brief Dual Awareness
**Switching Cue**: "What would bridge these perspective gaps?"
**Question**: What information transfer is needed?
**Method**: Specific documentation requirements:
- Conceptual explanations needed
- Step-by-step procedures required
- Verification and confirmation steps
- Error recovery and troubleshooting
- Success indicators and metrics
**Output Focus**: Specific bridging solutions

#### Step 9: Validation Criteria
**Cognitive Mode**: Brief Dual Awareness
**Switching Cue**: "How will I know the gaps are truly bridged?"
**Question**: How will we know if gaps are successfully bridged?
**Method**: Success metric definition:
- Zero-context user can complete procedures
- Common confusion points are prevented
- Error recovery is self-service
- Success can be independently verified
**Output Focus**: Measurable success criteria

### Phase 4: Iterative Validation
**Objective**: Test and refine gap bridging effectiveness

#### Step 10: Perspective Re-switching
**Cognitive Mode**: Return to Zero-Context
**Switching Cue**: "Forget what I discovered - read this fresh"
**Question**: Does the solution work from zero-context perspective?
**Method**: **Cognitive reset** then return to target user mindset:
- Deliberately forget analysis insights
- Read instructions as genuine first encounter
- Identify remaining assumptions
- Test procedures mentally from beginner state
**Output Focus**: Validation from authentic beginner perspective

#### Step 11: Gap Closure Verification
**Cognitive Mode**: Return to Zero-Context
**Switching Cue**: "Are the bridges actually accessible to beginners?"
**Question**: Are all critical gaps adequately addressed?
**Method**: Systematic verification:
- Each identified gap has specific solution
- Solutions are accessible to zero-context users
- Verification steps confirm successful knowledge transfer
- Recovery procedures handle expected failure modes
**Output Focus**: Gap closure confirmation

#### Step 12: Refinement Iteration
**Cognitive Mode**: Brief Dual Awareness
**Switching Cue**: "What still needs improvement?"
**Question**: What improvements are needed?
**Method**: Continuous improvement:
- Document remaining gaps
- Adjust solutions based on perspective switching
- Add verification steps where needed
- Improve clarity and accessibility
**Output Focus**: Iteration requirements and improvements

## Cognitive Load Management

### Single Perspective Focus
- Complete each phase fully in one perspective before switching
- Don't attempt to hold both perspectives simultaneously
- Use explicit switching cues to change cognitive mode

### Depth vs Breadth Balance  
- Phases 1-2: Go deep in each perspective separately
- Phase 3: Compare and contrast (brief dual awareness)
- Phase 4: Return to single perspective validation

## Application Framework

### Perspective Switching Techniques

#### 1. Knowledge Amnesia Simulation
**Method**: Temporarily "forget" expert knowledge
**Application**: Read instructions as if encountering concepts for first time
**Quality Check**: Can instructions be followed without external knowledge?

#### 2. Terminology Audit
**Method**: Identify all technical terms and acronyms
**Application**: Ensure each term is defined when first used
**Quality Check**: Are all concepts explained rather than assumed?

#### 3. Step Dependency Analysis
**Method**: Verify each step's prerequisites are satisfied
**Application**: Ensure no steps depend on undocumented prior actions
**Quality Check**: Can each step be completed with only prior step outcomes?

#### 4. Failure Mode Anticipation
**Method**: Predict what will go wrong for inexperienced users
**Application**: Add troubleshooting for anticipated failure points
**Quality Check**: Are common errors addressed with recovery procedures?

### Breakthrough Recognition Patterns

#### Cognitive Mirror Moments
- "I see where I went wrong"
- "I was assuming [X] without realizing it"  
- "The zero-context view shows me my blind spot"
- "I understand why I got stuck now"

#### Tunnel Vision Breaks
- Sudden clarity about alternative approaches
- Recognition of unstated assumptions
- Identification of missing context
- Understanding of why previous attempts failed

### Quality Indicators

#### Successful Perspective Switching
- ✅ Multiple knowledge gaps identified that weren't obvious initially
- ✅ Assumptions about user knowledge explicitly identified and addressed
- ✅ Instructions work independently without external knowledge
- ✅ Common failure modes anticipated and addressed
- ✅ Verification steps enable users to confirm success

#### Insufficient Perspective Switching
- ❌ Instructions assume prior knowledge or setup
- ❌ Technical terms used without definition
- ❌ Steps depend on undocumented prerequisites
- ❌ Failure modes not anticipated or addressed
- ❌ Success cannot be independently verified

## Protocol Applications

### Ideal Use Cases
- Expert cognitive debugging when stuck
- Breaking through tunnel vision and rigid assumptions
- Identifying root causes of persistent problems
- Documentation for unfamiliar user populations
- Integration guides for complex systems
- Cross-functional knowledge transfer

### Success Pattern Recognition
**Breakthrough Indicator**: Moment when expert realizes how much knowledge they were unconsciously assuming about user capabilities and context.

**Validation Indicator**: Zero-context perspective reveals missing information that expert perspective couldn't see.

## Case Study: CLAUDE.md Template Analysis

### Expert Stuck Point
Assumed users understood MCP architecture and Serena integration concepts

### Cognitive Debugging Breakthrough
**Expert Context**: Full knowledge of Serena setup, MCP concepts, tool relationships
**Zero-Context Mirror**: "What is MCP? Why should I care? How do I know if it's working?"
**Breakthrough Moment**: Expert realized they were writing for themselves, not users
**Cognitive Shift**: From "how to use advanced features" to "why this matters and how to get started"

### Critical Gaps Discovered
1. **Conceptual Framework**: Users don't know what MCP or Serena are
2. **Setup Verification**: Users can't confirm tool availability
3. **Mental Model**: Users lack symbolic vs file-based navigation concepts
4. **Error Recovery**: Users have no troubleshooting guidance

### Bridge Solutions Implemented
1. **Foundation explanations**: Define MCP, Serena, explain value proposition
2. **Verification commands**: Test tool availability at each step
3. **Before/after comparisons**: Show traditional vs semantic approaches
4. **Inline troubleshooting**: Error recovery integrated with instructions

### Validation Results
**Success Metrics**: Fresh Claude instances can successfully activate and use Serena tools following template guidance without additional support.

---

**Critical Success Factor**: This protocol's effectiveness depends on **authentic cognitive switching** rather than intellectual role-playing. The breakthrough insights come from genuinely experiencing the knowledge gap and allowing it to reveal expert blind spots. Superficial perspective switching produces no cognitive debugging value.

**Warning Signs of Insufficient Switching**:
- Still thinking in expert terms during "zero-context" analysis  
- Jumping to solutions instead of experiencing confusion
- Maintaining expert assumptions during beginner simulation
- Rushing through perspective transitions
