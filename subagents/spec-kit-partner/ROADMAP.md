## ‚ú® High-Priority Candidate Enhancements

### 1. Extensible Engine/Plugin Architecture
- **Goal:** Allow new analysis engines or workflow modules to be added via configuration or dynamic loading, without modifying core code.
- **Benefits:** Easier experimentation, community-contributed extensions, pluggable analysis.

### 2. Automated Diagram Rendering & Preview
- **Goal:** Enable automatic conversion of `.mermaid` diagrams to `.svg` or `.png` as part of workflow.
- **Benefits:** Instant previews for humans, compatibility with documentation platforms, richer audit logs.

### 3. Interactive/Conversational Setup
- **Goal:** Provide an initial interactive CLI or agent conversation for customizing directory names, roles, and initialization parameters.
- **Benefits:** Smoother onboarding for non-technical users, tailored agent instances for different teams/projects.

### 4. Multi-Agent Collaboration & Coordination
- **Goal:** Support communication and coordination between multiple Claude subagents (or with external APIs).
- **Benefits:** Distributed workflows, parallel analysis, combining perspectives from specialized agents.

### 5. Advanced Audit & Provenance Features
- **Goal:** Add automatic provenance/version history for memory graph nodes, role analyses, and workflow transitions.
- **Benefits:** Enhanced traceability, deeper explainability, compliance support.

### 8. Enhanced Error Recovery
- More robust context loss detection and auto-recovery.
- Option to snapshot/restore agent state at key milestones.

### 9. Expanded AI-Readable Artifact Types
- Explore support for other AI-friendly formats (e.g., JSON-LD, GraphML) for diagrams or knowledge graphs.

### 10. Built-In Onboarding & Help
- Add ‚Äúhelp‚Äù commands or inline guidance for first-time users.
- Auto-generated quickstart guides based on agent configuration.
