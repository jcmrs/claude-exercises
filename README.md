# Claude Exercises Library

A small, focused collection of cognitive and analytical exercises designed for use with Claude Code and expert review processes.

## Purpose

These exercises are intended to be run at the end of project phases, steps, or tasks—providing systematic approaches to uncovering missed insights, surfacing hidden assumptions, and reducing expert bias. They complement regular testing and review by introducing structured perspective and role switching.

## Contents

- **Perspective Switching Protocol:**  
  Systematic method for shifting between expert and zero-context viewpoints to reveal cognitive blind spots.  
  [See details](./perspective-switching/perspective-switching-protocol-v2.md)

- **Multi-Role Analysis Protocol:**  
  Framework for analyzing a problem through multiple professional roles, uncovering unique insights and integrating them.  
  [See details](./role-switching/multi-role-analysis-protocol-v2.md)

## Usage

Simply select and apply an exercise at the completion of a project phase or major task. Follow the steps in each protocol to guide discussion and analysis. They work best as a complement to standard review, not a replacement.

## Status

Currently includes two protocols. More may be added as new exercises are developed and proven useful.
