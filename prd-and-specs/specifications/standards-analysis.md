## Executive Summary
Describes the conventions, best practices, and required standards across all entities (agents, commands, profiles, roles, scripts, workflows) in Agent OS.

---

## Inventory & Directory Structure

- `standards/README.md`: Overview and index of all standards.
- `standards/<standard>.md`: Individual standard documents.

---

## Naming Conventions

- Standard filenames: `^[a-z0-9-]+\.md$` (e.g., `naming-conventions.md`)
- Metadata keys: `name`, `description`, `scope`, `examples`

---

## API Mappings

- `GET /standards` (list all standards)
- `GET /standards/<id>` (retrieve a standard)
- `POST /standards` (create new standard)
- `PUT /standards/<id>` (update)

---

## Validation & Error Handling

- Standards documents must include required metadata and valid scope.
- Duplicate or conflicting standards are rejected.
- Return 400 for metadata errors, 404 for not found.

---

## Testing Recommendations

- Validate standards enforcement across all entity types.
- Simulate missing or conflicting standards.

---

## Recommendations

- Use standards as a contract for development and review.
- Enforce standards validation in testing and CI.
- Document all fields, examples, and scopes in [examples.md](../examples.md).
